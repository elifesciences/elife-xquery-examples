# Introduction

At eLife we naturally have a lot of XML. Often we want to run quick queries over our XML to
extract a short report, or to check for errors in the XML. We have found Xquery used via
basex to be useful for some of these tasks. This repo contains some example Xquery
scripts.

# eLife XMl

We run these scripts over our XML corpus. You can access a copy of our XML corpus
from the github repo [elife-articles](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-articles).
